Private repo
https://github.com/ecbme4040/AI_Certificate_DeepLearning_Course/tree/main/resources_for_students
which is under repo
https://github.com/ecbme4040/AI_Certificate_DeepLearning_Course


and public repo
https://github.com/ecbme4040/AI_Certificate_DeepLearning_Course_public


are coupled together because of 2U page display needs:
* The text to be rendered on 2U pages is saved in the private repo
* All figures are saved in the public repo, so that they can be drawn on a 2U page.
* so 2U support team created links that make is possible to combine the two to render everything needed.
